- Make server discoverable.
  - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mDNSResponder-client-1.0.3/docs/Network-DNS-MDNSResponder-Client.html
  - reference https://github.com/hass-emulated-hue/core/blob/master/emulated_hue/discovery.py
- use logic monad to record statuses
- get the group state upon starting the server (how?)
- support Event api?

DON'T:
- Get group state from lightStates if it exists (ie. a proper group
  set state from MQTT was sent to the group topic)
  - problem: not all lights in the group may support the state.
