- Upon group state query, compute average between lights
- Proper user management
  - accept a message on mqtt topic (maybe huebridge/virtualbutton ) to press the button
  - where to store user db? /var/lib/mqtt2hue.yaml ?
- support Event api?


DON'T:
- Get group state from lightStates if it exists (ie. a proper group
  set state from MQTT was sent to the group topic)
  - problem: not all lights in the group may support the state.
