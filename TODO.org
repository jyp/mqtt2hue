- Wait a moment (so that mqtt has a chance to update its state and
  inform us back) before answering hue requests.
- Upon group state query, compute average between lights (?)
- support Event api?

DON'T:
- Get group state from lightStates if it exists (ie. a proper group
  set state from MQTT was sent to the group topic)
  - problem: not all lights in the group may support the state.
