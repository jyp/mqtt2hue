- Fix getBridgeConfig (in particular whitelist)
- make all the state structure strict (transitively)
- Don't make several copies of the same user in users.yaml
- use logic monad to record statuses
- get the group state upon starting the server (how?)
- support Event api?

* DON'T:
- Get group state from lightStates if it exists (ie. a proper group
  set state from MQTT was sent to the group topic)
  - problem: not all lights in the group may support the state.
